Environmental Setups
Pytorch ≥ 1.6.0, Torchvision ≥0.7.0

Data Preparation
 RGB-D SOD, we employ the following datasets to train the training sets of NJUD, NLPR, and DUTLF-Depth,while STERE, NJUD, NLPR, DUTLF-Depth, SIP, LFSD, RGBD135, SSD and ReDWeb-S datasets are employed for testing the RGB-D SOD task.You can directly download these datasets by following: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yuqpXDuVt6IM0k5OTUQIDA 提取码: yqj9.

 First, you should choose the specific backbone version. For the swin version, we provide Swin-DESS(S) and Swin-DESS(B).
